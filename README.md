# Beer Lookup

This application was created for an article in [Code Magazine](http://www.codemag.com/Magazine). It consists of a Sinatra application that consumes the [BreweryDB](http://www.brewerydb.com) API for beer search results.

## Demo

You can see the app live at [http://beer-lookup.herokuapp.com](http://beer-lookup.herokuapp.com).

## Requirements

* Ruby 1.9 or greater
* a valid BreweryDB API Key
 
If you do not have a BreweryDB API Key, you can [register for one](http://www.brewerydb.com/developers). The api key must be provided as an environment variable called `BREWERYDB_API_KEY`.
